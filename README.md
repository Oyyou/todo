Based on the code changes from the pull request, the README file should be updated to reflect the new name of the project, which is now "Todo app" instead of just "todo." Additionally, the description can be made clearer. Here is the updated README:

```markdown
# Todo app
A simple Todo app built with React to manage tasks efficiently.
```

This change maintains the existing style and clarity while providing a more descriptive overview of the application.
