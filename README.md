Based on the code changes and the context provided in the commit messages, the README file needs to be updated to reflect the new project name and provide a clearer description. The project has been identified as a "Todo app," and the previous description indicated it was related to testing AI technical writing, which is not relevant to the current implementation.

Hereâ€™s the updated README:

```markdown
# Todo app
A simple Todo application built with React and TypeScript.
```

This update clarifies the project purpose and maintains a consistent format.
